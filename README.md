Instructions After Download

1) Open "Mobile-App-Development-master" (folder) and navigate to then open the folder "m.a.d"
2) In this folder, search for a file called "GoogleService-Info.plist", and double click it to open it in XCode. 
3) Where it says "BUNDLE_ID", to the left find the string of text starting with "com." Double click on this, and edit it to be some random, unique string in a similiar format. For example: com.gafblatesting2.testing. Copy this text and save it for later setup use. 
4) After saving the file, close out of it, and exit the "m.a.d" folder. Back in the "Mobile-App-Development-master" folder, you should see a file called "m.a.d.xcworkspace". Double click this file to open it within XCode. After opening Xcode, you should see, on the left most column, "m.a.d" and "pods". Click "m.a.d" once, and you should see a settings page open to "General" 
5) In the field "Bundle Identifier, replace the text there with whatever text you used in Step 3. 
6) Now head down towards the "Signing" section, and where it says "Team", click and scroll down and click "Add Team". This should open up a new window where you are prompted to enter an Apple ID. We have pre-created one with an email as [iLibrarynhs@gmail.com] and password [iLibrarygafbla1]. 
7)After logging below "Team", signing certificate should be filled out with some details. If you get an error message, read the directions, and click try again. 
8) There are two options moving forward: you can either run our app on IOS Simulator, or you can run it on your Apple Device. If you choose to run it on the Simulator, you won't be able to test the "Snapshot" or "Live Text" pages on our app, because they require access to a camera. Attempting to open "Live Text" within the simulator will cause an error and crash the app. If you do choose to run it on the simulator, at the very top where it says "Generic IOS Device" next to "m.a.d", make the Simulator either an iPhone 6, 6S, 7, or 8. All these devices will properly scale the app, and run it. Click on the big play button to the left (sideways triangle) and now you should see the simulator opening up our app. For details on the features of the app, please check the "Instructions" word document. If you choose to use a phone, continue the steps below. 
9) Similarly, if you wish to properly run the app on a phone, an iPhone 6S, 7, or 8 are the best options. Any of the "Plus" models will work too, but the scaling while be off. Plug in your phone to your Mac, and follow the instructions in Step 8 for setting up an emulator, except scroll to the top and pick your device. After clicking run, and the app compiling, you should see a popup that says "enabling debugger support". Click cancel on this, and proceed to run the app again. This time you should get a popup saying "Developer not trusted". This means you've succesfull installed the app on your phone, and have one more step to go. 
10) On your phone, go to Settings, and scroll down to General, and under "Device and Profile Management", trust "iLibrary". After you do this, you can now run the app. 
11) To login, the preset credentials are [ga@fbla.org] and password [testing].
12) Remember to be connected to the internet to run the app, without Internet access, you won't have access to many of the app's features.
