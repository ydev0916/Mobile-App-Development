2018 FBLA Mobile App Development Project || Northview High School || Devansh Yerpude & Anish Ganga

Instructions After Download

1) Open the m.a.d.xcworkspace file in XCode, build and run on iPhone 8, 7, 6S, or 6. It is extremely important that you open the .xcworkspace file, as if you do attempt to build and run the .xcodeproj file, you will recieve errors, as the .xcodeproj file does not have the CocoaPod Integrations required for Google Firebase.
2) For the app to properly function, you must be connected to the internet. Our app utilizes Google Firebase to authenticate users, store books, and retrieve data. Without an internet connection, the app will not work.
3) Preset Login Credentials [email: ga@fbla.com.] [pass: testing]
4) Our app features the ability to <br/>
a) login through an email/password system that authenticates and validates each seperate user <br/>

d) search through our database of books by title<br/>
